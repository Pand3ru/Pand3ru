# 🐧 Pand3ru (aka Panderu)

"Yes I use Arch btw, yes I use Vim, yes I watch Primeagen, 
yes I use a tiling WM, yes it's DWM, yes I study CS, 
and yes, I wear my knee-high striped socks proudly."

## 🚀 About Me
🎓 Just a uni student pretending to understand computer science. Arch Linux enthusiast, Vim devotee, and DWM power user. If it's quirky or hipster in the tech world, I'm probably doing it.

## 🛠️ What I Play With
- **Languages:** C, Go, Python, Bash, C# and a tiny bit of Rust
- **Projects:** See **[Projects](https://panderu.org/projects/)**
