# 🐧 Pand3ru (aka Panderu)

"Yes I use Arch btw, yes I use Vim, yes I watch Primeagen, 
yes I use a tiling WM, yes it's DWM, yes I study CS, 
and yes, I wear my knee-high striped socks proudly."

## 🚀 About Me
🎓 Just a uni student pretending to understand computer science. Arch Linux enthusiast, Vim devotee, and DWM power user. If it's quirky or hipster in the tech world, I'm probably doing it.

## 🛠️ What I Play With
- **Languages:** C (when feeling nostalgic), Go (when in hurry), C# (uni forced me), python (for work)
- **Projects:** From terminal-based file explorers to custom stream integrators for Jellyfin. See **[Projects](https://panderu.org/projects/)**

## 🌟 Highlight Projects
- **[Tuxplorer](https://github.com/Pand3ru/Tuxplorer)**: Terminal-based file explorer because who needs a GUI?
- **[jellyfin-streamer](https://github.com/Pand3ru/jellyfin-streamer)**: Streaming integration for Jellyfin, because why not?

## ⭐ Fun Facts
- My socks have more stripes than my terminal has colors.
- Currently working for SUSE
- I have a very sassy blog
- Destined to become a sysadmin...
